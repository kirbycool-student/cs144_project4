Q1: 
Q2:
Q3: We set the viewport width to the device width and made the user unable to zoom in or out. We also ensured all the elements were fit to the screen size by setting their width's to be 100% when the device width was detected as less than 480px.
Q4: We set the textbox width to be 100% so that it would resize with the screen and maintain a width of the entire screen size.
